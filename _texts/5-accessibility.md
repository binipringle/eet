eet uses the World Wide Web Consortiumâ€™s [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) AA conformance level as its accessibility standard. We look forward to adopting [WCAG 2.2.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/) when it comes out in 2021.

CUNY's [IT accessibility](https://www.cuny.edu/accessibility/) website provides lots of resources and information on technology accessibility.

See also CUNY School of Law's [Statement on Accessibility](https://www.law.cuny.edu/about/legal/statement-accessibility/).
