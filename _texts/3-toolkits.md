Jx is what gives a court a power to act. Two kinds: subject matter jx (smjx) is the court’s power over a specific dispute. Personal jx (pjx) is the court’s power over an individual.  

See [Beginning of a rule statement](https://binipringle.github.io/civilprocedure/texts/1-rules/).

Diversity jurisdiction (divjx) is (1) complete diversity of citizenship among all parties AND (2) amount in controversy (aic) exceeds $75k. Citizenship for persons is the state of residence. Citizenship for corporations is its principal place of biz OR where it is incorporated. *It gets tricky when there are multiple parties in different states and one moves.*

So there has to be complete diversity of citizenship? In other words, the opposing parties need to reside in diverse places. If they live in the same place there is not diversity of residence/citizenship.

Supplemental jurisdiction: when federal court has jurisdiction over some claims, it can exercise supplemental jx over state claims arising from the same case or controversy **if there is a common nucleus of operative fact.** When there is a federal claim, then the plaintiff can bring her state claims *only if* the federal claim and the state claim have a common nucleus of operative fact.

## Review of subject matter jurisdiction

The underlying presumption of civil procedure is testing the rules to see if we can get into federal court.

Federal question: federal law, U.S. Constitution, U.S. Treaties – if a law was made by the federal govt., it’s a federal question. If a law was made by a state, it's not federal. To see if something is federal look for “U.S.C.” (U.S. Code); look for “Title” (e.g. Title VII, Title IX claims); anything based in U.S. Constitution (1st A, 2nd A, equal protection analysis); if you still can’t tell? Google it. Sometimes we don’t know because sometimes law is regulations from agencies such as EPA (I assume that some agencies are state agencies).

Among all parties = No plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant. You can have various defendants from the same place, but if one plaintiff

Subject matter jurisdiction there is three ways: federal question OR diversity jurisdiction OR supplemental jurisdiction

I have one lawsuit I want to file in state court – unlawful imprisonment – but I also want to bring a claim of battery or rape (not in federal law) – so I will try to bring that as supplemental jurisdiction so that the federal court can have jurisdiction over the battery or rape claim because it has the same operative nexus.

If you’re doing an analysis you can skip the federal question – go straight to the state claim because you will address the federal question through supplemental jurisdiction.

## The dreaded Erie Doctrine

Erie Doctrine is not conceptually complex. It is technically tedious.

Focus on concepts!!

**Statutory law v. common law**

- Statutory law: written law, positive law
- Common law: unwritten law, decisionary law, case law

**Vertical choice of law v. horizontal choice of law**

- Vertical: NY district court (Fed) located in same state as NYS court
- Horizontal: NYS court, e.g., state tax court

**Clarification: Forum v. Venue**

- Forum is really talking about when you are in fed court in ny, the forum state is nys. We have four fed district courts in ny – sdny edny ndny wdny – so any of these courts is in the forum state of ny.
- Venue is the specific place where the lawsuit is happening. Venue is which district you will appear in when there are various districts in a state.

Reading Erie doctrine is like reading a VCR manual.

**Pre-Erie**

**1789**

Rules of Decisions Act aka 28 USC 1652

- The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. (June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 944.)[^1]

[^1]:Historical Revision Notes: Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 725 (R.S. § 721). “Civil actions” was substituted for “trials at common law” to clarify the meaning of the Rules of Decision Act in the light of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Such Act has been held to apply to suits in equity. Changes were made in phraseology. [Cornell Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1652)

**1842**

**Tyson v Swift** became the law of the land for really long – courts interpreted “laws of the several states” to mean only statutory law “written law” “codified law” – held that in diversity jurisdiction only statutory law could be read … In 1842 this was a strange way to interpret this because if a fed court was in state jurisdiction and there was a written state law the fed court would use it but if there was no state written law, the fed could devise a law.

- Dv jx – scenario a – in a state where there is a statutory law – fed district court uses it
- Dv jx – scenario b – no statutory law – fed district court uses common law

So there was a big discrepancy between what could happen in one state or another because if no statute in a state federal district court would use common federal law that was developing. Huge discrepancy in potential outcome of a case. No equal protection of the laws.

**1938 (barely post-Lochner)**

Era of getting out of let the market take care of itself; now growing appetite for govt. action and uniformity among the states; growing discussion of federalism – conversation between need for strong federal govt. but also states wanting some autonomy. So, the federal rules of civil procedure was invented. :) FRCP intended to seek uniformity; assumption that forum shopping is bad and unjust.

**Erie – forum shopping**

Erie v. Tompkins = Railroad v. Person

Tompkins was a resident of PA walking along the road in PA when RR Co. (NY company) passed by, door swinging open, hits Tompkins, severs his arm. Tompkins wanted money damages. For negligence. Tompkins takes it to NY. The law was so different that in NY he was awarded $30K. Erie applies for certiorari (asks supreme court to take the case). When Erie applies for cert it is saying that the rules of the game are unfair, the rules are rigged, because the way that plaintiffs can go forum shopping is unfair, no due process.

Brandeis is looking for a reason to overturn Swift v. Tyler. Interesting that this is 1938 – for a long time there were all sorts of courts doing all sorts of things; this is really a modern rule that has brought us to where we are right now. Federal law no longer rules; not binding authority, but there are lots of ways in which federal 2nd circuit law affects state law, and that is what Erie did; it brought a lot of vertical conformity between courts. Erie doctrine relates to which law is applied by the federal court sitting in divjx.

- **Rule from Erie:** federal courts are allowed to apply their own rules when it’s procedure, but requires federal court to apply state substantive law.  

Divjx does not have to have any federal claim; it’s when its citizens of different states. Because courts specifically wanted to avoid me being able to drag someone’s ass to ny if I want to sue someone from Texas. In divjx there is no federal claim being raised. Do we go to the state where something happened? Generally, like in the situation in Erie, it’s not in the state where it happened, but the state where the defendant is from (Erie from NY).

Q: What state law is considered procedural and which is considered substantive?

- **Procedural:** rules of civil procedure; burden of proof standards (generally the preponderance standard – 51% standard) (all sorts of ways states might treat burden of proof at different stages of the procedure)
- **Substantive:** state law causes of action; damages (there’s guidance – 2nd circuit guidance); statute of frauds (if contract issue and statute of frauds comes up it’s considered substantive); choice of law rules (if I live in VA and I’m affected by a TX law, conceptually a district court may apply a TX state law).

**Big question: state statute of limitations?** Is that **procedural or substantive?**

- Procedural: where a substantive right is not conditioned upon the statute of limitations
- Substantive: where a substantive right is conditioned upon the statute of limitations (this is really the rub in Erie)

**What if it is not entirely clear if a state law is substantive or procedural?** If it’s not really clear, there are a series of tests. It really is fact based. You have to put on your lawyering cap and try to figure out conceptually if it’s procedural or substantive.

- If state law has substantive characteristics, and there is no conflicting federal statutory law? Substantive.
- If there is a clear federal mandate that conflicts with the application of state law? Procedural.

**Apply the policy of Erie:**

- Will the decision make the outcome of the case so substantially different that it will promote forum shopping? If yes, substantive. If no, procedural.

if substantive, it has to be applied by federal court. If substantive, we will argue that state law should be applied *only if the state law is favorable to us* – if unfavorable, we will argue that the state law is procedural. We want every favorable rule to apply to us and every unfavorable rule to get out.

- **Hypo:** If court law says documents submitted to court have to be PDF-A and no other PDFs are admissible, is this law procedural or substantive? Probably procedural because I probably wouldn’t take my client to another venue because I had to submit a PDF-A.

- **Hypo:** State law requires person to file answer to a complaint within 31 days. Fed law is 21 days. Is state law substantive? (there is a federal mandate but assuming there wasn’t). Technically this is a procedural rule – this is where the Erie rub comes in – argue it in your complaint even – this is where state law should be applied because not applying it will make a substantive difference to my client.

- **Hypo:** What if state law says no matter how severe injury damages are capped at $100,000? **Damages are always substantive.** A law that places a cap on the amount of damages would def make me take my case to another forum.

- **Hypo:** State law says if claiming less than $1M no jury trial, case would be seen by judge (or a “bench” trial). Substantive? I think likely yes. There is an argument to be made both ways. Probably substantive because so much comes down to what your case is, whether your client would present well to a jury, if case hinges on a technical question of law I might argue that my client would benefit from a bench trial. If I don’t want the federal district court to apply the state law I will argue that it is procedural.

- **Rule from Erie:** the federal court is not allowed to independently judge the construction of the law.

If there is no controlling state law to guide, the fed court must predict how the states highest court would rule – if unclear fed court must predict. Imagine fed district court applying state law. No guidance, no legislative intent, vagueness, basically if the state law has room for interpretation, then the federal judge is required to predict rather than fill in.

Let' s say you're a state court judge – and the case law is unclear. The role of a judge is to fill in all the gaps in the case law. In a case where a federal judge is applying a state law and theres a gap and they have to fill it in, the district court is tasked with looking at appellate courts and trying to predict how the appellate courts would rule – Erie says that the federal judiciary cannot make state law, so the fed judge has to make clear how they would predict that a state judge would rule on the case. The fed judge is trying to predict what an appellate state judge would rule on the issue.

**It's not precedent-setting;** suddenly the fed judge is applying the law in the most just and most even way possible *in this case*, but this does not become precedent for state law.

I think here we have already found that the law is substantive; ask Rosa!!!

Hypo will always start in state law. Hypo will say you are in federal district court in divjx and there is a law that is state law that you want to argue can be applied to your case.

What is the bird balancing test? Ask Rosa.

For next week the case she really wants us to read for Thursday is Worldwide
