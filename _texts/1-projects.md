## DH in Prison

Eet is working to develop a project for teaching digital skills and pre-law courses in prison without a connection to the internet. This project grows out of [DH in Prison](https://binipringle.github.io/dh-in-prison/), a capstone and thesis for the Master of Arts in Digital Humanities at the Graduate Center, City University of New York, by Sabina Pringle (June 2020). Pringle's thesis discusses the need for including digital humanities courses in college-in-prison programs, and outlines how minimal computing methods can be used to offer incarcerated students an introductory digital humanities course and teach them the necessary technical skills. The accompanying capstone, [Intro to DH](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/), is a proof of concept for the course itself.
