## DH in Prison

Eet is working to develop a project for teaching digital humanities, digital skills and other courses (CALI lessons?!? :)) in prison without an internet connection. This project is driven by the belief that incarcerated students in college-in-prison programs would welcome the opportunity to study digital humanities and acquire transferable digital skills that will help them get jobs upon release. Eet's DH in Prison grows out of and builds upon [DH in Prison](https://binipringle.github.io/dh-in-prison/), a capstone and thesis for the Master of Arts in Digital Humanities at the Graduate Center, CUNY (2020), which outlines how minimal computing methods can be used to offer incarcerated students an introductory digital humanities course and teach them the necessary technical skills. The accompanying capstone, [Intro to DH](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/), is a proof of concept for the course itself.
