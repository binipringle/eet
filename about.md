I built this site to house the Equitable and Ethical Technology student organization at <a href="https://www.law.cuny.edu/">CUNY School of Law</a> in the summer of 2021. I chose to organize my work on a static site in order to have a lot of control over its structure and form, following <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing principles</a> for legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. The Jekyll theme I used to build this site is <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/ed/">Ed.</a>, distributed under an MIT license, software copyright (c) 2016â€“present Alex Gil, Karl Stolley, and contributors.
